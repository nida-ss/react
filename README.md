# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# state 
state is a way to store and manage data that can change over time and effect and how the components are render. We define state using the useState Hook, which allows you to set initial value and provides a way to update that state. 

# Hooks 
hooks are new addition in react 16.8
they let you use state and other react features without writing a class.

# USESTATE()
usestat() hook allow us to track state in a functional component. State generally refers to data or properties that need to tracking in an application.

# Props
In React, Props is short for "Properties". It refers to the data that is passed from a parent component to a child component, allowing the child component to receive and use the data.
